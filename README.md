Just simple image editor, that allows to change brightness or contrast.
Works only for PPM images.
I wasnt used Cmake because it was just a small work, to test if im able to process images.
For same reason i didnt used such patterns as Abstract factory for opening images, Bridge for image format imple, singlton for main thread and so on.
I didnt used any lib for image processing for same reason, and i didnt used QT  or whatsoever beause it was requiered, to not use them.

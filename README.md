Just a simple image editor that allows changing brightness or contrast.
It works only for PPM images.
I didn't use CMake because it was just a small project to test if I am able to process images.
For the same reason, I didn't use patterns such as Abstract Factory for opening images, Bridge for image format implementation, Singleton for the main thread, and so on.
I didn't use any library for image processing for the same reason, and I didn't use QT or anything similar because it was required not to use them.
